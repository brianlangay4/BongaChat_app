i have added a mssql bak file contains all database i created for testing in my code i havenâ€™t included creating table if not exists if your interested in making your own database stracture you can change my default database structure 

for now all the database tables and more database content store in bk file located in file named dbbackup
you will have my database i created with demo data inside it for few users

how to use the file upload the file to your mssql server and use it as recovery file to restore data or anyother efficient way after uploading thedatabase you will have all the tables and data needed to run the program
use your database connection details to database connection class in java inside the project and fiill in your personal connetion data to database if all tables are available in your database the application will run successfully
